# jbinto/bikeways-geojson

Converting City of Toronto Bikeways ESRI Shapefile to something usable.

Github supports rendering GeoJSON according to this post by a Github employee:
http://ben.balter.com/2013/06/26/how-to-convert-shapefiles-to-geojson-for-use-on-github/

It's 50MB so I had to make a separate repository for this one file.
